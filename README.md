This repository complements our publication entitled "Neurovascular coupling and CO2 interrogate distinct vascular regulations". 
It provides:
- the Matlab scripts used to fit model functions on our data and determine the onsets of the responses,
- the data used to generate the main figures of the publication (Excel file).

Compatibility: These scripts have been tested with MATLAB 2018a and 2022b on Windows 10 & 11.

Contact: For further information, please contact either Marine Tournissac (marine.tournissac@inserm.fr) or Serge Charpak (serge.charpak@inserm.fr).
